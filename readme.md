This is the 2nd week of the 10 weeks Javascript.
In this week we'll be discovering how twe can build an application which queries pending transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

Most transactions will have to be mined on the Ethereum Blockchain. One issue which arises is the presence of arbitrage therein the pending transactions method in the memorypool.

Our goal is to be able to query the transactions using websocket methods with teh alchemy sdk.

Further down the project we'll see if it is actually feasible to participate in such arbitrage activities on the ethereum blockchain.
